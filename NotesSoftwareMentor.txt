What is Manual Testing?   

Testing that is done manually, without the help of scripts or automation tools. 

Where to start?
Manual Test is done first, Automation Testing is done after

Overall process that any tester will follow:
Doesn't matter what methodology you use, Agile/Scrum, Waterfall, V-Model

1.	Analyze Requirements:  read the requirements given by the client, understand what it is they want, and what scenarios are possible.
		if there are any gaps, make them known.

2.	Test Planning
		
3.	Test Case Creation

4.	Test Execution:  Depending on pass or fail of test cases, fails are put into defect/bug logs and sent back to developers for fix.
		Another iteration of the test cases is performed.

5.	Test Reports

Agile/Scrum is short term, Waterfall and V-model are longer term and often less used now.

Objectives of Software Testing:

1.	Find defects/Prevent defects

2.	Ensure good quality

3.	Software meets product requirements, meets customer expectations

4.	Software is fit for use, it can meet the requirements but is not practical to use.
